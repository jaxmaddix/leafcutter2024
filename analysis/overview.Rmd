# **About Leafcutter Ants**

Leafcutter ants are known for their characteristic behavior of cutting leaves from trees and carrying them back to their colonies. Then, they use the leaves as fertilizer for a fungus that they grow like farmers growing crops. The ant larvae feed on the fungus. The ants can detect chemical signals from the fungus and change their foraging behavior to meet the fungus's needs.


# **My Initial Observations**

From January 1-15, 2024, I visited Costa Rica as a class trip. I conducted an observational study on foraging behavior of leafcutter ants. My goal was to assess qualities of leaves that are rejected far from the colony, vs. leaves that are carried all the way to the colony entrance and rejected at the doorstep. I also conducted a behavioral analysis to understand the sequence of events that occur when a leaf is rejected by the ants.

When we arrived at CCI, I noticed that there were a lot of leaves dropped right outside the colony, but few leaves dropped down the ant trail. I was curious why the ants would expend energy carrying leaves all the way back only to reject them right outside the door. I surmised that they must be gaining some new information about the leaves near the colony.

# **Methods**

## Leaf Analysis

**See a more detailed description and statistics [here](leaf_analysis.html).**

I set up a transect line with markers every meter, from the colony entrance along the leafcutter path, until the path diverged and went into the woods.

I built a quadrat measuring 30x90 cm using basic materials available at the field station (sticks and twine). I placed the quadrat over each marker and sampled every leaf fragment within the quadrat. By sampling every leaf within the quadrat, I could measured changes in leaf rejection as the ants got closer to the colony by measuring the total mass of leaves dropped per quadrat, and counting the number of leaves per quadrat. 

**Quadrat that I built:**

After I collected the leaf fragments, I also took pictures of them all with a ruler for scale.  I used ImageJ to calculate the surface area of each leaf, to determine if the size of rejected leaf fragments changed closer to the colony. 

**Example of what the rejected fragments looked like:**

## Behavioral Analysis
**See a more detailed description and an example video [here](behavior.html).**

I also conducted a behavioral analysis by recording videos of ants carrying leaf fragments near the colony. Since this colony was noctural, I recorded at night when they were very active. I observed 8 instances of a leaf being reject.  During each rejection event, a similar sequences of events occured involving multiple other ants touching the leaf fragment before it was rejected.
