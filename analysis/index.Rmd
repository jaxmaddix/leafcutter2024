## **Welcome**

Welcome to my website about my research on leafcutter ants, [*Atta cephalotes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atta_cephalotes), in Costa Rica. This research took place at [Camaquiri Conservation Initiative](https://www.camaquiri.com/) in Lim√≥n Province, CR, from January 5-8, 2024.

## **About me**

My name is Jaxson Freund. I'm a 1st year Biology Masters student at Villanova University, and I finished my B.A. in Biology from Swarthmore College in 2023. I study marine invertebrates and my research at Swarthmore focused on how diet and rearing temperature mitigate the ability of sea urchin larvae to survive thermal stress.
